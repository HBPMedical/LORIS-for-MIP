# [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aces/Loris.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aces/Loris) LORIS setup for the Medical Informatics Platform of the Human Brain Project

This is a setup of LORIS' v21.0.1 tailored for the hospitals that have joined the Human Brain Project and use the [Medical Informatics Platform](https://github.com/HBPMedical). The purpose of this dockerized version of LORIS is to add MRI Quality Control functionality to the MIP's [DataFactory](https://github.com/aueb-wim/ehr-datafactory-template) (as an extra step prior to the MRI volumetric brain feature extraction pipeline). This version of LORIS has been modified in order to store additional information about the patients (subjects) which is neccessary for the linkage of the two systems (LORIS and MIP). Also, the procedure of uploading DICOM files (batches) into LORIS has been automated and customized (see **Uploading DICOMS into LORIS** section). In addition, the procedure of extracting NIFTI files from LORIS to MIP's DataFactory imaging pipeline has been automated.


## Prerequisites

* docker: version 19 or later
* docker compose: version 1.22 or later

Optional tools

* [HBP-MIP Data Quality Control Tool](https://github.com/HBPMedical/DataQualityControlTool)


## Deployment steps in MIP hospital local server

1. Clone this repo into `/data/LORIS/` on MIP hospital local server.

2. In the folder `/data/LORIS/` run:
  
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Get in the loris_apache container by running:

```bash
docker exec -it loris_apache bash
```

Note that when you login into loris_apache container you must see that your environment is displayed as (loris-mri-python).

4. In loris_apache container run:

```bash
bash /data/loris/aueb/curl_query.sh
```

5. In loris_apache container run:

```bash
source /opt/minc/1.9.17/minc-toolkit-config.sh
```

6. In loris_apache container run:

```bash
cd /data/loris/bin/mri
bash imaging_install_aueb.sh
```

(Note that when you execute imaging_install_aueb.sh, your working directory must be /data/loris/bin/mri, also you must source beforehand minc-toolkit-config.sh )

#### Notes

`curl_query.sh` creates the LORIS db schema, mysqluser and frontend user of loris

* Mysql root access -> 172.28.1.2, root, neopass
* for Mysql loris user -> lorisuser, neopass
* loris frontpage user -> lorisuser, 1234

## Usage of LORIS for MRI Quality Control in MIP

### Importing DICOMS into LORIS

The incoming DICOMS must be placed in the `/data/LORIS/dicom_in` folder. The structure of the subfolders must be like:

```bash
.
|-- <patientID-1>
|    |-- <patientID>_1
|    |   |-- dcm files of multiple scan series having the same StudyID(aka visitID)
|    |  .
|    |  .
|    |-- <patientID>_N
|  .
|  .
|-- <patiendID-N>
```

The [HBP Data Quality Control](https://github.com/HBPMedical) tool has the functionality of producing automatically the above folder structure, while filtering out dcm files that are invalid or don't meet the [HBP-MIP DICOM minimum requirements](https://hbpmedical.github.io/deployment/data/).

In `loris_apache` container we run:
Execute

```shell
python /data/loris/python/dicom_uploader.py
```

dicom_uploader.py will process each dicom-folder within the folder `/data/LORIS/dicom_in` in the host machine and afterwards moves that dicom-folder into the <b>dicom_post</b> folder. If the uploading process is succesful then the `dicom_in` and the `dicom_post` folders will be empty.


### Performing Quality Control check using LORIS

Open a web browser in `<miphospital_serverIP>:8088` and log in LORIS. The defualt user is **lorisuser** and password **1234**.
